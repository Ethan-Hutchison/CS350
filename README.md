Pwmled2

The point of the pwmled2 project is to create code that has the LEDs on a board alternate between which one is on and which is off.
For this project I think I made the desired product well, one thing I could work on is making the code more readable and understandable with comments.
The skills from this project that will help me in future products is a better understanding on how embedded systems work.
To make this project maintainable I tried to keep it organized by what each part does.

Project

The point of the project system is to read from a thermostat and then using buttons on the board to adjust the temperature then using an LED to see if the temperature is higher than what the thermostat reads to represent heat turning on.
For this project I think that i did well at creating a system that meets all of the needs given. I could improve on how the code is organized and how readable it is.
From this project I know how to work with embedded systems better and can use these skills in future projects for more advance systems.
To make the project maintaonable I tried to keep it as organized as I could and have comments to explain the system.
